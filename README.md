The paper can be found in the pdf file in the repo. To replicate the results the code has been provided.
The main_loaded.ipynb loads the saved models instead of training them from scratch. To run the code, clone the 
repository and install the packages using pip.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*For some reason the HMM produces different results on google colab.*
